st.write("Our web app runs Monte Carlo simulations on popular blackjack strategies: High-Low, Halves, and Zen. \
         Using basic strategy and deviation charts, we simulate game scenarios to see how each strategy might play out over time. \
         You'll get clear, easy-to-understand stats on ending balances from these simulations. Plus, if you're curious about how a \
         certain strategy might perform over a specific number of plays, our built-in regression model can give you a prediction. \
         Whether you're a seasoned player or just curious about blackjack, our tool offers insights to help you understand the game better.")
